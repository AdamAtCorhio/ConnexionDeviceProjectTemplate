# Contexture's Visual Studio Templates for Connexion Devices

## Intallation

User Visual Studio Templates are installed here:

    C:\Users\[YOUR_USERNAME_HERE]\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#\

Just extract/place the **CORHIO_ConnexionDeviceLibrary** folder in this location

## How to use

When creating a new project in Visual Studio, just search for **Connexion** or **CORHIO**

## Features

Feature(s) above and beyond the new **Connexion device project** the **Connexion Management Client** provides you:
 - Uses the new, lean .csproj file format from .NET core (It builds a .NET 4.8 Framework assembly, it just uses the new .NET core project file format).
 - Contexture's .editorconfig file is included automatically.
 - XML comments on all the class members.
 - CORHIO branded device icon (actually a hybrid of the CORHIO logo and the Connexion logo, for the lulz).
 - Fixes some spelling mistakes that were in the comments.
